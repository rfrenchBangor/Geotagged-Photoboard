# Geotagged-Photoboard
Welcome
The Geo-Tagged Photo Web Board is aimed to help outdoor event organisers gain feedback from the public as to any negative impact on the environment caused by the event, as well as to help event organisers comply with the Environmental Certificate Scheme.
 
Users will browse to a web-page form that will allow them to select a photo to upload and add comments that they wish to include. These images are stored on the server, along with the latitude and longitude values of where the image was taken, as well as any comments. The image will show how the environment has been affected by the outdoor event.

The geographical location of where the image was taken will be placed on a web board integrated into a separate webpage. The event organiser and users can view this web board by browsing to the webpage, and then display the images taken at these locations to then judge the severity and type of impact on the environment. Having this visual aid, the event organiser is in a more informative position, making it easier for them to plan for or rectify any environmental issues caused by the event.
